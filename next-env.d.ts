 * Note: This file is auto generated to help add additional types for TypeScript support in Next.js.
 * Next.js will create a file named next-env.d.ts in the root of your project. This file ensures
 * Next.js' types are picked up by the TypeScript compiler. You cannot remove this file, however,
 * you can edit it (but don't need to).
 * Note: Next.js does not enable TypeScript's strict mode by default. When you feel comfortable
 * with TypeScript, you may turn this option on in your tsconfig.json.
